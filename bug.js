This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This is common in asynchronous operations where the state update happens later than the component's render method attempts to access it. For example, if you make an API call in `useEffect` hook to fetch some data, and then try to render it immediately after.  The state may not have been updated yet, resulting in `undefined` or `null` being accessed.
