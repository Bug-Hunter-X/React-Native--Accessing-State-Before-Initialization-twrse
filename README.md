# React Native: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized.  The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

The issue arises when asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, are involved.  The state update happens after the component renders, leading to `undefined` or `null` values being accessed. This often causes runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

The solution involves using conditional rendering or the optional chaining operator to gracefully handle the case where the state variable is not yet initialized.
